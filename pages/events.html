            <h1>Events & Projects</h1>
            <p>At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we believe that Slovak culture should be <b>experienced</b>, not just learned. That’s why we organise <b>a variety of events for everyone—families, children, adults, and individuals who simply want to connect with Slovak heritage, make new friends, and enjoy great company</b>.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re a parent wanting to engage your child in Slovak traditions, a single professional looking to expand your social circle, or someone who just loves Slovak culture, our variety of events and workshops provides a welcoming space where people can enjoy themselves, have fun, eat traditional Slovak food, and build lasting connections.</p>
            <p>Some come for the cultural experience, some come to practise their Slovak, and others just come to enjoy good company over a coffee or a glass of wine. Whatever your reason, you are always welcome.</p>
            <br>

            <h2><span class="underline">Upcoming Events</span></h2>
            <p>Join us for our upcoming events—come with friends or come alone; you’ll always find a warm and friendly group to welcome you.</p>
