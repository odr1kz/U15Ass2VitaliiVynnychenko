            <h2><span class="underline">Who We Are</span></h2>
            <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester is a <b>registered charity</b> dedicated to <b>preserving and promoting Slovak language and culture</b>. We provide <b>Slovak language education</b> and organize <b>cultural and community activities</b> to help Slovak-speaking families maintain their heritage while living abroad.</p>
            <p>While our primary focus is on supporting <b>Slovak-speaking children and families</b>, we warmly <b>welcome anyone</b> interested in learning the Slovak language and engaging with our traditions. Beyond our Saturday school, we offer <b>various workshops, events, and social activities</b> where individuals of all ages can <b>connect, learn, and take part in our cultural community</b>.</p>
            
            <br>

            <h2><span class="underline">Our Mission</span></h2>
            <p>Our mission is to: At <b>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester</b>, our mission goes beyond just teaching the Slovak language. We are here to <b>keep our heritage alive</b>, to ensure that children growing up abroad don’t lose their <b>connection to their roots</b>, and to create a <b>place where Slovak culture thrives</b>—even far from home.</p>
            <p>We believe that language is more than just words; it carries <b>identity, history, and a sense of belonging</b>. Through our work, we bring Slovak-speaking families together, helping them <b>build friendships, strengthen their cultural ties, and feel at home even while living in the UK</b>.</p>            
            <p>Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even further.

We are here to <b>support families, guide them, and make sure no one feels lost when navigating life between two countries</b>.</p>
            <p>Above all, we are here to create a <b>community</b>—one that welcomes, supports, and celebrates <b>Slovak language, traditions, and the people who cherish them</b>.</p>
